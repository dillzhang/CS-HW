-Generates a puzzles automatically upon running
-Once puzzle is generated, user is ask to input a col, row, direction, and specified word
	-The program will check if that word is in the correct position
		-If it is, The puzzle is reprinted with those letters in capitalcase and removed from the wordlist
		-Else, The user is told they have failed
	-Given a 1000 attempts before the program self-terminates.
	-Once wordlist is empty, User is told they have won
-After each round, the user is ask if they chose to end
	-Upon type "Y", the program stops and prints out the key

Further Improvements:
-Dummy Proofing inputs --> If user inputs nonnumerics for row, col, or directions, program will crash.
-Adding a border to the puzzle --> Simple toString Modificiation
-Better contrast between found words and rest of the puzzle
-Graphic Interface?
-Any Suggestions would be much appreciated
